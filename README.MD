## The Idea
This  project  aims  to  create  a  system  that  can  automate  the  blood  donation process  that  exists  in entities
such as the Lebanese  Red  Cross. This  process is  currently  done  manually  and  we  believe  that  automating  it  would 
provide a faster and more efficient outcome that could prove to be paramount in life-threatening situations

## Components

### Donor form
The document that people who want to add their names to the database will fill.
### Request form
The document that people in need of blood will fill out in order to generate a request.
### Queue of requests
This data structure should save the requests, so we don't lose any blood request.
### Donors database
This database holds the blood donors who will get picked for a request.
